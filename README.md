# Gitlet - our own version of Git
Implemented a version-control system using Java that mimics commit, branch, merge, remote push/pull, and other main features of Git.
Utilized LinkedHashMap to store and match commit id and blobs, and to construct the commit tree. Serialized and deserialized the runtime objects using the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function. Tested functionalities with unit and integration tests.
